# OOP Concepts in Java
This repository has some java programs. They were taken at my graduation and during the Course Video Course (https://www.cursoemvideo.com/course/java-poo/aulas/java-poo/modulos/exemplo-pratico-em-java/). Each package represents an exercise requested by the teacher. Below I will explain the programs present in each one of them.
 
## First Program (package - firstprogram)
### Pen (Class - Pen)
This class models a basic pen. The object has some attributes:
* model (String)
* color (String)
* tip thickness (float)
* percent of the amount of ink (float)
* if it is capped (boolean)

The program has Getters and Setters, the method toWrite() (it shows if you can write or not) and toString() (return a text that shows all attributes).

### Pen Manager (Class - PenManager)
It contains only the main method. He instantiates two different pens and uses their methods.

## Bank (package - bank)
### Checking Account (Class - CheckingAccount)
It models a checking account. The class has attributes to identify the bank account: 
* Bank code (String)
* Account number (String)
* Bank name (String)
The program has methods for the user to pay (debit or credit) or to deposit money. He also can see his credit limit and the bank statement.

### Checking Account Interface (Class - Chacking Account Interface)
In this program, I used the swing library of Java JOptionPane class. I made a login window, how I am not using a database, it exists one "registered" account.
